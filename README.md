An MD file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. It is saved in plain text format but includes inline text symbols that define how to format the text (e.g., bold, indentations, headers, table formatting). MD files are designed for authoring plain text documentation that can be easily converted to HTML.
